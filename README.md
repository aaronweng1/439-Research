 Abstract— In an era of rapidly evolving theft, the need for
 timely models has never been so apparent as it is now. If we
 are to prevent such unfaithful transactions, we must ensure
 the strategies and datasets we use are up to date. In this
 paper, we explore the efficacy of previously explored machine
learning techniques with a more recent dataset, and compare
 these strategies at a broader scale. In exploring previous papers,
 we found that our models not only match, but in certain cases,
 exceed the accuracies presented by the explored models.
 Additionally, fine-tuning these models reveals a notable im
provement in their ability to generalize across datasets, highlight
ing their robustness in detecting unseen fraudulent patterns. The
 Decision Tree-based ensemble approaches (xgboost) consistently
 outperform other classifiers, achieving precision and recall rates
 exceeding 99% on datasets, however SVM achieves results even
 closer to 100% accuracy and near zero FPR upon hyperpa
rameter tuning. This research underscores the importance of
 combining data quality improvement techniques with integrated
 classification frameworks to enhance the reliability and effec
tiveness of fraud detection systems. Furthermore, it suggests
 potential for broader applications of these strategies in addressing
 other types of anomalous behaviors, paving the way for future
 advancements in machine learning-driven fraud prevention.
